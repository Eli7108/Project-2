    <h1>Favorite Location</h1>
    <p>I don't travel long distances very often and I haven't been on 
        any luxury trip, however one place I visited that was exceptionally 
        fun was Hershey Park.

    <p>I've visited Hershey only a few times but those few visits were enough for me to make a conclusion. They have many activities so you'll never
        get bored however the park is very large making it nearly impossible to see everything in one day.
        Just outside the park sits Hershey's Chocolate Factory. Inside you can purchase merchandise, chocolate, and other candies they make.
