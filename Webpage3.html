        Everyone has at least a couple hobbies that they engage in during their free time. My hobbies include video games and drawing; two things I've enjoyed
        and improved in over the years. Drawing is a relaxing activity for me and is very fulfilling once a picture or project is complete. 
        Video games are a fun pass time to do with some friends and help relieve stress.
